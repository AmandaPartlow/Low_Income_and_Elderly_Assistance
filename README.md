### Nashville Software School Group Project - Interactive Excel Dashboard For Informing Low Income and Elderly Assistance Grants

*Original assignment: You have been tasked with creating an interactive dashboard for an organization that provides assistance for low income and elderly taxpayers. You have been asked to create this dashboard using the 2016 IRS individual tax return data.*

This was a group project, worked on by [Cristina Attfield](https://github.com/cattfield), [Antonio Frederick](https://github.com/430modena), and me. The final dashboard includes a map which shows the 20 states with the lowest income population, the 20 states with the highest elderly population, and the states where the two overlap. There are also two bar charts that indicate the top 10 from each category as well as a stacked bar that features a drop down to allow the user to compare each state to the national average. The dashboard concludes with a general recommendation where we think the organization should focus their efforts.
